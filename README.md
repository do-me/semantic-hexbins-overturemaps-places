# Semantic Hexbins

## See also this demo for Bonn based on Instagram posts: https://do-me.github.io/semantic-hexbins/

A lightweight frontend app using transformers.js showcasing the use of semantic similarity for geospatial applications such as geosocial media. Data source: Overturemaps Places.

Building on previous research:

## Idea 

The paper describes an approach to use semantic similarity for geospatial purposes, like georeferenced social media data.

## Data samples

The data samples stem from Overturemaps Places. There are currently 10k, 40k and 60k random samples. As this app is thought for demo purposes only it's running entirely in your frontend!

## Further ideas 
Dynamically load data from Overturemaps for an AOI of your choice and index on the fly.
